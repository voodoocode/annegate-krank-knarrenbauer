## Version history

### ‚ú® New in v0.3: Replacement of other people

As per public request on r/de:

Other relevant people are being found and replaced with silly names.

I added some logic/randomness wheter a combined name of first-, middle- and lastname is used _or_ a full nickname.

## Contribution

Feel free to open pull requests with new names or persons.

NOTICE: be sure to not have the extension activated in the browser, when using the Github frontend editor.
It will probably also do it's replacements in there and introduce bugs. This will be fixed in a future version, but just to be sure.

When adding new persons follow this format of the object:

```javascript
{
    regexName: /(?:Vorname )?Nachname/gi, // looking for optional firstname, lastname not optional
    regexAbbrev: /VN/gi,
    substitutionsFirst: ["Vorname1"],
    substitutionsMiddle: ["Zwischenname1"],
    substitutionsLast: ["Nachname1"], // for hyphen "-" concatenated, names add those in front of the lastname
    substitutionsComplete: ["Spitzname1"],
  }
```

Please don't submit stuff, that is out of the borders of satire.

## üî® Development

- first do: `npm install`
- for development in Firefox run `npm run start:firefox`
- the extension will reload if any source file changes

Please use Prettier by using `npx prettier --write .`
